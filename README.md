# csv_up
Command console made to upload csv file as arrays

Here is my first attempt to code a console command in PHP with the help of Symfony5.

To execute the command run in your console : 
`app:update-stock`
A CSV test file is under the public directory. It is possible to add your own csv file to test the command up. This file must have a valid date (Y-m-d) as its title.
